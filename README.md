# Connect Four

Program is a recreation of the classic game "Connect Four" using Python and the PyGame library.

Currently working on creating a function AI to play against using a minmax algorithm
and alpha-beta pruning.


To run the game, go into the "build" folder and run the "Connect_four.exe" file
